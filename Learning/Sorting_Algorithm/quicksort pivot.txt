Tradeoffs — quick checklist

Randomized pivot — excellent average case, very simple, probabilistic protection against worst case. Use when you want simple, fast, robust code.

Median-of-three (first, middle, last) — cheap heuristic that often avoids bad splits on partially sorted input. Good practical default.

Tukey’s ninther (median of three medians) — better quality pivot for big arrays, more comparisons; used when partitions must be good.

Median-of-medians (select) — deterministic O(n) pivot with worst-case O(n log n) Quicksort; heavy to implement, 
only use when worst-case guarantees are required.

Always-first / always-last — simplest but disastrous on already-sorted or reverse-sorted input (degenerates to O(n²)).

Special case: many duplicates — use three-way partitioning (Dutch National Flag) + any pivot; this handles equals cheaply.
